**Product Concept:** AI-Powered Fan Skill Engine.

## **1\. Core Visual Identity**

The visual identity is defined by the **"Flow of Mastery"**—a kinetic, abstract aesthetic that avoids celebrity likeness to maintain a safe legal posture.

* **The "F" Monogram:** A bold, white sans-serif letterform wrapped in kinetic cyan and violet trails.  
* **The Full Wordmark:** "Fanmania" set in a bold, clean sans-serif font to project authority and competition.  
* **Design Pattern:** High-contrast vibrant neon elements set against deep, atmospheric backgrounds.

## **2\. Color Palette (The "Digital Neon" System)**

Use these exact hex codes to ensure consistency across the mobile interface and marketing assets.

| Element | Hex Code | Description & Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Deep Space** | \#0D1127 | Primary app background for "Dark Mode" feel. |
| **Electric Cyan** | \#00F2FF | Selection states, active buttons, and "Competitive" highlights. |
| **Vivid Violet** | \#8A2BE2 | High-rank indicators and "Contemporary Fusion" swirls. |
| **Magenta Pop** | \#FF00FF | Notifications, "Skill Under Threat" alerts, and urgency. |
| **Pure White** | \#FFFFFF | Primary typography for maximum legibility. |

## **3\. UI & Component Standards**

All components must reinforce the **Skill, not Proximity** principle.

* **Generative Cluster Icons:** Use abstract geometric shapes (Cubes, Triangles, Waves) to represent categories like "Afrobeats" or "Electro-Swing".  
* **Progression Engine:** Progress bars use a multi-stop horizontal gradient (Violet → Blue → Cyan).  
* **Glassmorphism:** UI cards use 15% opacity backgrounds with soft blurs to allow background glows to bleed through.  
* **Difficulty Selectors:** \* **Inactive:** Ghost buttons with thin \#333B58 borders.  
  * **Active:** Glowing border using \#00F2FF with a slight outer neon blur.

---

## **4\. Typography Rules**

* **Primary Typeface:** Clean Sans-Serif (Inter, Montserrat, or Gilroy).  
* **Headings:** Bold weight, White (\#FFFFFF), high tracking for a premium feel.  
* **Technical Data:** Monospace or Semi-bold for "Mastery" percentages and Rank status.  
* **Tone Constraint:** Never use decorative or "fan-girl" fonts; maintain a neutral, competitive tone.

## **5\. Implementation Prompt for AI Tools**

"Design a mobile UI for 'Fanmania,' a competitive fan platform. Use a Deep Space (\#0D1127) background with Glassmorphic cards. Incorporate Electric Cyan (\#00F2FF) and Vivid Violet (\#8A2BE2) kinetic swirls. All category icons must be abstract geometric shapes—no human faces. Typography should be bold, white, and modern sans-serif. High-contrast, neon-glow aesthetic."
